			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "N/A - Task is effectively complete.",
			"reasoning": "The task involves standard UI component creation and data binding. Since all subtasks are marked 'done', the remaining complexity is negligible. The implementation relied on standard React patterns without complex algorithmic logic."

			"taskTitle": "Asset System & Drag-and-Drop Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "N/A - Task is effectively complete.",
			"reasoning": "This task had high inherent complexity due to the integration of React DnD, coordinate mapping between DOM and SVG elements, and strict validation logic for asset placement. However, the provided logs indicate the implementation is complete."

			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Turn Management & Economic Engine",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Undo/Redo' subtask into specific implementation steps: 1. Middleware configuration for state history, and 2. UI controls and state hydration logic.",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task. Implementing a robust Undo/Redo system (Subtask 5) alongside a strict state machine for phases is architecturally difficult. Managing the 'Action Phase' lock to prevent race conditions or illegal moves requires precise state management."

			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Conflict Resolution Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "N/A - Current subtask breakdown is sufficient.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity arises from synchronizing the asynchronous visual nature of combat animations (Framer Motion) with the synchronous data updates of Redux. Ensuring the UI blocks user interaction during the animation sequence while handling edge cases like 'Counterattacks' adds significant logic overhead."

			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Narrative Generation & News Feed",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "N/A - Current subtask breakdown is sufficient.",
			"reasoning": "The logic is primarily string manipulation and template injection. While the 'Context-Aware' generation requires a good data structure for tags, the technical risk is low compared to the game engine tasks."

			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Persistence & Save System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "N/A - Current subtask breakdown is sufficient.",
			"reasoning": "The core APIs (LocalStorage, FileReader) are standard. The complexity lies in the 'Schema Migration' and validation logic to ensure that loading an old save file doesn't crash the application as the data model evolves."
